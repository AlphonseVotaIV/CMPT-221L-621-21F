We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

I would most likely use GoDaddy in order to set up my website, as the URL [stingerwebsite.com] is up for grabs and it's less money to use for two years than using a URL such as [stinger.io], which is 59.99 for a year.  I would most likely use docker to help me run my UIs together, as well as help me manage my website's assets.
